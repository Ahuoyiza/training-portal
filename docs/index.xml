      <description>Welcome to InterMine python tutorial! In this tutorial, I will show you how to interact with the intermine registry, which lists the different InterMines available on the web, and contains information about their URLs, the datasets and organisms you can find in each InterMine, and a few other things.
First, don’t forget to run pip install intermine in your terminal, if you haven’t already.
Then, let’s look at cells.</description>

      <description>This tutorial is for users who use Python to get information of a mine or an organism. This tutorial consists of 14 parts.
We use FlyMine as an example.
We recommend you to use Jupyter Notebook to run following code. If you are new to Jupyter, you can visit this.

      <description>Welcome to the first intermine python tutorial! In this tutorial, we will go through the basics of intermine python queries and how to write your first query. To get started, you would want to ‘pip install intermine’ in your terminal first.
Let’s look at cells. We start by importing the service class from InterMine’s webservice module. Let’s click it.
Then let’s create a query object. The “new query” method can help us do this.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the second tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! In the previous tutorial we learned how to select the output columns of choice. In this tutorial, we’ll look at adding constraints to our queries to filter the results.
Let’s start with creating a service and query object, like we saw earlier.
If we want to view all the possible output columns at once, we can pass “*” as a parameter to the select function like this.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the third tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! In the previous tutorial, we learned about adding constraints to our query so that we could filter the results. In this tutorial we will take a look at some more different types of constraints.
First, let’s create a query object like we saw earlier.
The first type of constraint we will look at is Unary Constraint. A unary constraint is one that does not take any value but can be used to check if a particular attribute is absent or present.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! In the previous tutorials we learned about the basic backbone of a query - views and constraints. This short tutorial will talk about another feature of an InterMine query - Outer and Inner Joins.
When we add a path to a query, even if it is in the view, then by default there is a constraint involved. Our query will consist of only those records that have information in the fields or attributes that are described by the path.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fifth tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! This tutorial will talk about dealing with the results of our query. You can either store the results into a file (using a library like csv) or you can process the results immediately after you extract them.
Now we write a short query for genes, and add all views for publications associated with that gene, then explore the results.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the sixth tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! In the previous tutorials we learned how to add filters to limit the query results. However, it is often useful to view the results without filters. This tutorial will show you how to process, sort, and analyse the query results.
Usually, we begin by creating a query object. Our example for this tutorial is going to be related to gene expression, represented in InterMine by the RNA Sequence Result class.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial we will look at templates, which are like pre-prepared queries you can easily re-use. Templates can do everything that a query can do. Everything that you can do with a query - add new constraints, add new views, process the results using the results iterator can be done with templates as well.
While writing queries of your own, you would have probably realized that there is a lot of duplication of effort.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the eighth tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! v If you don’t have an account, you can create one at flymine.org
Once you have made an account, you can use the web service to create a query of your choice and save it as a template. This template can be used through Python API or through the web service.
To login and access your templates through Python, you can provide your login information as shown below.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the ninth tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! This tutorial will talk about how you can create and save lists in your account. You will need to provide your login information while creating a service object like in the previous tutorial.
You can either provide a list of identifiers (for example, gene symbols) and the InterMine Server will try to match them with objects in the database, or you can provide a query that specifies exactly what you want.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the tenth tutorial in the InterMine python tutorial series! This tutorial will talk about how you can perform enrichment calculations on lists that you have access to.
‘Enrichment’ means that the feature (GO term, domain) occurs for those genes more than would be expected by chance. It is calculated using the hypergeometric distribution which is described further in the InterMine documentation
Enrichment widgets are useful to find items such as GO Terms or publications which are associated with your gene list more than would be expected by chance.</description>
